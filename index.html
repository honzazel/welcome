        Dear Kia,<br><br>
        Thank you for being a part of what is, to me, a very important chapter in my life. I will always cherish our time together in my memory. My wish is that I made your stay in Germany just a little bit better and that I helped you take your mind off things for a few brief moments. You are a kind and wonderful person, and I know you will achieve great things (like successfully shopping at the self-checkout). Honestly, your company was more important to me than you might realize, and I am grateful for it.<br><br>
        -Jan
