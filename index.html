        Dear Kia,<br><br>
        Thank you for being a part of what is, to me, a very important chapter in my life. I hope that I made your stay in Germany just a little bit better and helped you take your mind off things, even if only for a few brief moments. You are a very kind and thoughtful person who knows how to listen, and I know you will achieve great things (like successfully shopping at the self-checkout). My favorite part of our time together was how appreciative and welcoming you were toward everything we did together. You are more important to me than you might realize, and I am grateful for you being a part of my life.<br><br>
        -Jan
