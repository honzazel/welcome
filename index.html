        Dear Kia,<br><br>
        Thank you for being a part of what is, to me, an important chapter in my life. I hope I made your stay in Germany maybe just a little bit better and helped you take your mind off things, even if only for a few brief moments. You are a kind and understanding person, and I know you will achieve great things (like successfully shopping at the self-checkout). Thank you for being so warm toward me, appreciating everything that we did together, and making me feel less alone. You are more important to me than you might realize, and I will cherish the memories of our time together.<br><br>
        -Jan
